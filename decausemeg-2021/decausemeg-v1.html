<h2> THE PROCESSIONAL</h2>


<h2>WELCOME</h2>
<p>
Dearly Beloved.
</p>

<p>
We are gathered here today to honor the union of Megan and Anthony together in marriage.
</p>

<p>
You all have been invited to be here today, to bear witness to this ceremony
solemnifying their Everlasting bond.
</p>



<h2>STATEMENT OF CONSENT</h2>

<pre>
Anthony Nicolas DeCausemaker and Megan Elizabeth Borruso, 
do you come here of your own free will, 
to be united in marriage, forevermore?

If so, say <em>"Yes, we do"</em>
</pre>



<h2>STATEMENT OF MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>
Throughout the ages, countless have attempted to answer the timeless question,
"What is Love?" When I spoke with the bride and Groom, it was Megan who offered
the words of Bell Hooks, from <em><u>all about love</u></em>, who says: </p>

<pre>
"The moment we choose to love,
we begin to move 

against domination.
against oppression.

The moment we choose to love
we begin to move twoards freedom,
to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others.

That action 
is the testimony of love, as the practice of freedom...

When we choose to love,
we choose to move agsinst fear,
against alienation 
[against] separation.

The choice to love 
is a choice to connect

to find ourselves 
in the other.
</pre>

<p>
As we grow and change through our lives, so too does our bond--<em>through Love</em>.
That which we cannot tolerate alone, is much more easily endured together, <em>through Love</em>.
</p>

<p>
And that which we could not pursue alone, is attainable together, through 
the <em>Art of Marriage</em>, which states:
</p>

<pre>
It is the little things, that are the big things.
It is never being too old to learn and grow.

It is at no time taking the other for granted; 
the adventure should not end with the honeymoon, 
it should continue throughout all of your years.

It is setting a mutual set of goals, objectives, and values.

It is doing for eachother--not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, but in the
spirit of Harmony.
It is forming a circle of love, that gathers the whole community.

It is establishing a partnership in which the independence is equal, 
the dependence is mutual, 
and the obligation is reciprocal.

It is sharing a sense of humor, a sense of wonder, and a sense of purpose.
It expressing and showing Love, as often as you can.

It is the common search for not only the answers, 
but the questions, that reveal the truth and beauty of 
Life's greatest mysteries.

Finally, it is not only <b>MARRYING</b> the right partner, 
but <b>BEING</b> the right partner.
</pre>


<h2>EXCHANGE OF THE RINGS</h2>

<pre>
Anthony, what token of devotion do you offer your beloved?
<b>Place the ring upon her finger, and repeat after me:
"With this Ring" / "I Thee Wed"</b>

And Megan, what token of devotion do you offer your beloved?
<b>Place the ring upon his finger, and repeat after me:
"With this Ring" / "I Thee Wed"</b>
</pre>



<h2>EXPLANATION OF THE RINGS</h2>
<p>
The wedding ring is a circle, the symbol of unity. A circle has no beginning.
A circle has no end. These rings symbolize the joining of two lives in an
unbroken circle, in which no matter what direction you go, you always come back
together.
</p>



<h2>THE VOWS</h2>
<p>
I call upon you now, Megan and Anthony, to declare your vows before those
gathered here today.
</p>

<p>
Those of you who are already joined in Marriage or partnership may want to
silently renew and reaffirm <b>YOUR OWN VOWS</b> today, by taking the hand of your
partner during the ceremony. Others in relationships, kinships, or friendships
may too want to join hands, and reflect upon your own bonds--with eachother, and
with the bride and groom--for marriage is first built upon friendship.
</p>

<pre>
and now

Do you Anthony, take Megan, to be your lawfully wedded Wife?
to have and to hold,
for better or for worse
for richer or for poorer
through sickness and through health
to love and to cherish,
today, and all the days,
for as long as you both shall live?

If so, say "I DO"
