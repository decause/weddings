<h2> THE PROCESSIONAL</h2>


<h2>WELCOME</h2>
<p>
Dearly Beloved.
</p>

<p>
We are gathered here today to honor the union of Megan and Anthony together in marriage.
</p>

<p>
You all have been invited to be here today, to bear witness to this ceremony
solemnifying their Everlasting bond.
</p>

<h2>STATEMENT OF CONSENT</h2>

<pre>
Anthony Nicolas DeCausemaker and Megan Elizabeth Borruso, 
do you come here of your own free will, 
to be united in marriage, forevermore?

If so, say <em>"Yes, we do"</em>
</pre>



<h2>STATEMENT OF MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>
Throughout the ages, countless have attempted to answer the timeless question,
"What is Love?" When I spoke with the Bride and Groom, it was Megan who offered
the words of Bell Hooks, from <em><u>all about love</u></em>, who says: </p>

<pre>
"The moment we choose to love,
we begin to move 

against domination.
against oppression.

The moment we choose to love
we begin to move towards freedom,
to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others.

That action 
is the testimony of love, as the practice of freedom...

When we choose to love,
we choose to move against fear,
against alienation 
[against] separation.

The choice to love 
is a choice to connect

to find ourselves 
in the other.
</pre>

<p>
As we grow and change through our lives, so too does our bond--<em>through Love</em>.
That which we cannot tolerate alone, is much more easily endured together, <em>through Love</em>.
</p>

<p>
And that which we could not pursue alone, is attainable together, through 
the <em>Art of Marriage</em>, which states:
</p>

<pre>
It is the little things, that are the big things.
It is never being too old to learn and grow.

It is at no time taking the other for granted; 
the adventure should not end with the honeymoon, 
it should continue throughout all of your years.

It is doing for eachother--not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, but in the
spirit of Harmony.
It is forming a circle of love, that gathers the whole community.

It is establishing a partnership in which the independence is equal, 
the dependence is mutual, 
and the obligation is reciprocal.

It is sharing a sense of humor, a sense of wonder, and a sense of purpose.
It expressing and showing Love, as often as you can.

It is the common search for not only the answers, 
but the questions, that reveal the truth and beauty of 
Life's greatest mysteries.
</pre>


<h2>EXPLANATION OF THE HANDBINDING</h2>
<p>
For those who may not be familiar, a Handbinding ceremony recognizes that Love,
like Life, is dynamic.  These ceremonies were done traditionally in Celtic
lands. Vows could be taken for a year, or they could be taken forever, because
those ancestors understood that love changes from moment to moment, and that
every couple is unique - every relationship is unique.
</p>

<p>
Megan and Anthony have chosen today, to commit to one another for the rest of their
lives, with the understanding that the love they commit to, is dynamic and
fluid. What we now celebrate is the eternal connection between their souls,
no matter what physical form their Love may take.
</p>

<h2>DECLARATION OF INTENT</h2>
<p>
Megan and Anthony,<br/>

You make these vows today, signifying your souls are bound
eternally, no matter your physical form.<br/>
You make these vows today, committing to honor this connection your souls
share.<br/>
You make these vows today, acknowledging that they are sacred, and through the
blessing of your loved ones, strengthened, and not easily broken.
</p>

<p>
Knowing this, Anthony Nicolas DeCausemaker and Megan Elizabeth Borruso,
is it your intent to enter into this commitment to one another?
</p>

<p>
If so, say "We do."
</p>

<h2>HANDBINDING CEREMONY</h2>

<p>
Then Let Us Begin.
</p>

<p>
Megan and Anthony, you will be making a total of six vows to one another before
those gathered here today.<br/>For each, I will ask for your commitment, which
you both shall respond together, "We will."
</p>

<p>
OFFICIANT: Will you share in eachother’s pain, and seek to protect the other from it, and ease them of it?
<br/>
BOTH: We will.
<br/>
OFFICIANT: Let the binding be so.
</p>


<p>

</p>


<h2>EXCHANGE OF THE RINGS</h2>

<pre>
Anthony, what token of devotion do you offer your beloved?
<b>Place the ring upon her finger, and repeat after me:
"With this Ring" / "I Thee Wed"</b>

And Megan, what token of devotion do you offer your beloved?
<b>Place the ring upon his finger, and repeat after me:
"With this Ring" / "I Thee Wed"</b>
</pre>



<h2>EXPLANATION OF THE RINGS</h2>
<p>
The wedding ring is a Circle, the symbol of Unity. A Circle has no beginning.
A Circle has no end. These rings symbolize the joining of two lives in an
unbroken Circle, in which Love knows no End.
</p>

<p>
Those of you already joined in Marriage or partnership may want to silently
renew and reaffirm <b>YOUR OWN VOWS</b> today, by taking the hand of your
partner during the ceremony. Others in relationships, kinships, or friendships
may too want to join hands, and reflect upon your own bonds--with eachother,
and with the bride and groom--for marriage is first built upon friendship.
</p>

<h2>THE EXCHANGE OF VOWS</h2>
<p>
And Now:
</p>

<p>
OFFICIANT: ANTHONY, Do you vow on this day to share Megan's pain, her joy, her burdens, and her dreams, and 
to help her navigate the mysteries of life together." If so, say "I Do."
</p>

<p>
OFFICIANT: MEGAN, Do you vow on this day to share Anthony's pain, his joy, his burdens, and his dreams, and 
to help him navigate the mysteries of life together." If so, say "I Do."
</p>


<h2>ANNOUNCEMENT OF MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>
Megan and Anthony, you have exchanged vows, you have exchanged rings, and you
have proclaimed the bond of your souls before these witnesses,
<br/>therefore<br/> by the strength of your bond, and by the power vested in
me, I now pronounce you Husband and Wife!
</p>

<b>You May Seal your Bond with a Kiss!</b>
</p>
