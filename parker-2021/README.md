<h2> THE PROCESSIONAL</h2>


<h2>WELCOME</h2>
<p>
Dearly Beloved.
</p>

<p>
We are gathered here today to honor the union of Amber and Benjamin together in
Holy Matrimony. Marriage is a sacred act. It speaks to us through traditions
of the past, and a renewal of promises to the future.
</p>

<p>
You all have been invited here today, to bear witness to this bless-ed
ceremony, solemnifying their Everlasting bond.
</p>



<h2>STATEMENT OF CONSENT</h2>

<p>
Amber ______ Smith and Benjamin _________ Parker, do you come
here of your own free will, to be united as Husband and Wife, forevermore?
</p>

<p>
If so, say "Yes, we do"
</p>



<h2>STATEMENT OF MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>
Throughout the ages, countless books, poems, scriptures, and songs have
attempted to answer the timeless question, "What is Love?" Some would say:
</p>

<pre>
Love is Patient.
Love is Kind.
Love is not envious, or boastful,
arrogant, or rude.
Love does not insist on its own way;
Love is not irritable or resentful;
Love does not rejoice in wrongdoing,
but rejoices in the truth.
Love bears all things
believes all things
hopes all things
endures all things.
</pre>

<p>
As we grow and change through our lives, so too does our bond--<em>through Love</em>.
That which we cannot tolerate alone, is much more easily endured together,
<em>through Love</em>.
</p>

<p>
And that which we could not pursue alone, is attainable, together, through 
the <em>Art of Marriage</em>, which states:
</p>

<pre>
It is the little things, that are the big things.
It is never being too old to explore.

It is saying "I love you" as often as you can, but at least everyday.
It is never going to sleep angry.

It is at no time taking the other for granted; the adventure should not end
with the honeymoon, it should continue throughout all of your years.

It is setting a mutual set of goals, objectives, and values.
It is forming a circle of love, that gathers the whole family.

It is doing for eachother--not in the attitude of duty or sacrifice, but in the
spirit of Joy.

It is speaking words of appreciation and thoughtfully demonstrating gratitude.
It is making space in which the other can grow.

It is establishing a partnership in which the independence is equal, the
dependence is mutual, and the obligation is reciprocal.

It is sharing a sense of humor, a sense of wonder, and a sense of purpose.
It is having the capacity to forgive and forget.

It is the common search for not only the answers, 
but the questions, that reveal the truth and beauty of 
Life's greatest mysteries.

Finally, it is not only <b>MARRYING</b> the right partner, 
but <b>BEING</b> the right partner.
</pre>



<h2>EXCHANGE OF THE RINGS</h2>

<pre>
Benjamin, what token of devotion do you offer your beloved?
<b>Place the ring upon her finger, and repeat after me:
"With this Ring" / "I Thee Wed"</b>

And Amber, what token of devotion do you offer your beloved?
<b>Place the ring upon his finger, and repeat after me:
"With this Ring" / "I Thee Wed"</b>
</pre>



<h2>EXPLANATION OF THE RINGS</h2>
<p>
The wedding ring is a circle, the symbol of unity. A circle has no beginning.
A circle has no end. These rings symbolize the joining of two lives in an
unbroken circle, in which no matter what direction you go, you always come back
together.
</p>



<h2>THE VOWS</h2>
<p>
I call upon you now, Benjamin and Amber, to declare your vows before those
gathered here today. These pledges you make to eachother, shall bind your paths
in life hereafter.
</p>

<p>
Those of you who are already joined in Marriage or partnership may want to
silently renew and reaffirm <b>YOUR OWN VOWS</b> today, by taking the hand of your
partner during this ceremony. Others in relationships, kinships, or friendships
may too want to join hands and reflect upon your own bonds--with eachother, and
with the bride and groom--for marriage is first built upon friendship.
</p>

<pre>
and now

Do you Benjamin, Take Amber, to be your lawfully wedded Wife?
to have and to hold,
for better or for worse
for richer or for poorer
through sickness and through health
to love and to cherish,
today, and all the days,
for as long as you both shall live?

If so, say "I DO"
